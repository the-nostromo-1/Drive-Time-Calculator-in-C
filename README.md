# Drive-Time-Calculator-in-C

This is my first ever upload to GitHub. I am not sure if I did this correctly but theres a first for everything.
This simple project was made using Visual Studio 2022, so when I uploaded this project I was not sure if I had to include all of the extra files that VS2022 creates for the project or just the Source.c file?
